    "# Propagation of Uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of your labs you have been able to directly extract your experimentally determined values from the gradient or intercept of the line of best fit that you have superimposed onto your data. This has meant that in most instances, you can deal with your experimental errors by calculating standard errors and then performing a suitble regression analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have also noticed that sometimes we calculate the value of one parameter from another, where the latter parameter has an associated uncertainty. Often we also need to perform calculations including multiple variables that have their own associated errors. If either of these is the case, we need to be able to perform suitable error propagations. This appendix to the writing materials has been designed to demonstrate how to perform simple error propagations and provide you with the error equations for various common calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in depth look at how to perform error propagations, you should review chapter 4 of [\"Measurements and their Uncertainties: A Practical Guide to Modern Error Analysis\"](https://find.shef.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44SFD_ALMA_DS21177067650001441&context=L&vid=44SFD_VU2&lang=en_US&search_scope=SCOP_EVERYTHING&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=everything&query=any,contains,hughes%20and%20hase&offset=0) by Hughes and Hase.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing analysis in the lab it is key that you are able to do these calculations. When writing your report it may also be appropriate to include the equations used for your error propagations in an appendix at the end of the report.\n",

    "## Quickly Perform Error Propagation Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is taken from the final page of the the aforementioned textbook. It provides a very brief summary of how we can perform error propagation calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a linear function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = f(A,B),$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ have associated uncertainties of $\\Delta A$ and $\\Delta B$, respectively. It can be understood that the uncertainty in $Z$ due to the uncertainty in $A$ is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta _Z^A = \\lvert f(A+\\Delta A,B) - f(A,B)\\rvert,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the uncertainty in $Z$ due to the uncertainty in $B$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta _Z^B = \\lvert f(A,B+\\Delta B) - f(A,B)\\rvert.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Pythagoras' the total error can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta Z^2 = (\\Delta _Z^A)^2 + (\\Delta _Z^B)^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\therefore \\Delta Z = \\sqrt{(\\Delta _Z^A)^2 + (\\Delta _Z^B)^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming small uncertainties, the calculus based approximation to this result is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\Delta Z)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial A} \\right)^2 \\Delta A^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial B} \\right)^2 \\Delta B^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation can be used to determine the uncertainty for any function of $A$ and $B$. If the function was dependent on additional variables, we would just continue to add on terms to this equation for each variable. For example,  if $Z = f(A,B,C)$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\Delta Z)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial A} \\right)^2 \\Delta A^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial B} \\right)^2 \\Delta B^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial C} \\right)^2 \\Delta C^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single variable function this can be simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z = \\lvert \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial A} \\rvert \\Delta A. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Example Error Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula above, let us determine the error propagation equation for a very simple function $Z = A + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are variables with associated uncertainties. First we start with our general formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial A} \\right)^2 \\Delta A^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial B} \\right)^2 \\Delta B^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we replace Z with the actual function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (A+B)}{\\partial A} \\right)^2 \\Delta A^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial (A+B)}{\\partial B} \\right)^2 \\Delta B^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the partial differentials gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial(A+B)}{\\partial A} = 1, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial (A+B)}{\\partial B} = 1, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Z^2 =  \\Delta A^2 +  \\Delta B^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\therefore \\Delta Z = \\sqrt{\\Delta A^2 +  \\Delta B^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to propagate the error for a simple addition (or subtraction) we must simply add the associated uncertainties in quadrature... \n",

    "## Standard Error Propagation Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex functions, you may need to take the calculus approach to determine how to propagate the uncertainties, however, for standard functions it may be easier to use these pre-derived expressions.\n",
